<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Do you know what's in your fishstick? Was that salmon caught in Alaska and processed in China? Do you know the story of how your tuna was caught, canned and then made its way to your dinner table?</p>
<p>Global Dialogue members (fishers, processors, and retailers) are shifting the market towards traceability systems that enable tracking seafood from vessel to plate. They are developing industry standards in a pre-competitive environment that include solutions for small- and large-scale actors alike. The key element is linking traceability systems so they can seamlessly communicate with each other. Interoperable traceability will mean we know when, where, how and by whom the seafood we consume is caught, processed and shipped.</p>
<p>We need your expertise in designing technical solutions to capture data, creative ways to share that data, and strategies to convert data seamlessly. Ultimately, with your help we will make progress towards connecting the seafood industry to make sure we can answer these questions accurately in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Hacking Seafood Traceabilty</strong></p>
<p>On 21-22 October 2019, the GDST is hosting a Seafood Traceability Hackathon (Seafood Trackathon). Its mission is to promote seafood traceability and interoperability by sharing the standards and methods developed by the GDST with the seafood industry's technical community. Interoperability requires communication between and among seafood companies, retailers, brokers, processors and IT system providers that support them.</p>

<p>The Global Dialogue on Seafood Traceability (GDST) brings the seafood industry together to design the standards for interoperable seafood traceability. Only when the industry has aligned on how to trace seafood along the supply chain and works in unison with a common standard that allows systems to communicate with each other, will you be able to answer those questions.</p>

<p><strong>Learn</strong></p>
<p>Using a collaborative problem-solving approach, we will produce open-source solutions to challenges the seafood industry currently faces. Join us to understand what the seafood industry has created in the last two years to set the rules of the game for interoperable traceability - from aligning and defining what information should be collected on the water to how that information is formatted, and how this framework will help everyone from fishers to consumers. Join the hackathon so you can develop solutions that afford small-scale fishers a greater access to new markets. Create apps that tell the story of sustainably caught seafood. Contemplate big questions around data quality and data verification challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Network</strong></p>
<p>The GDST has brought together over 60 producers, processors, and retailers from the seafood industry from around the world. We have the biggest names in seafood talking about traceability. More than that, we have the attention of technical solutions providers, NGOs, certifiers, governments and the like. Join this hackathon to hear what they are thinking about in terms of the future of traceability, work with their tools and seize the chance to share your solutions with them!</p>

<p>Teams will have the opportunity to work on challenges in the following categories:</p>
<p><strong>#1 Key Data Element Verification:</strong> create data validation protocols and access permissions for key data elements captured on vessel</p>
<p><strong>#2 Interoperability using EPCIS: </strong>develop tools to read and write traceability data in leveraging GDST adapted EPCIS format </p>
<p><strong>#3 Identifier Technology: </strong>leverage existing identification technology to capture and transmit product provenance information</p>
<p><strong>#4 Blockchain Integration: </strong>develop traceability data transmission applications utilizing blockchain</p>

<p>To help you with the development of your solution, you can select one of the problem statement as a specific application of your solution. Each problem statement addresses at least one of the categories above.</p>
